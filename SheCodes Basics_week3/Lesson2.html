    <p>
      Greek yogurt is made from cow's milk that is strained to remove the whey,
      this results in a thicker consistency compared to natural yogurt. It also
      has a tangier flavour and can often be used as a healthier substitute to
      mayonnaise, sour cream or cr√®me fra√Æche.<br />
